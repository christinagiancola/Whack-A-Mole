# Whack-A-Mole

This whack-a-mole game was started while completing freeCodeCamp's "Learn JavaScript by Building 7 Games."
However, once I completed the coding exercise I found two significant bugs that I wanted to address:
1. The game timer did not reset once a round was completed. 
2. The game score also did not reset between rounds. 
So I ammended the code to fix these issues so a player can complete multiple rounds without refreshing the browser. 

My next steps are to style the game and make it more responsive for different window sizes.
